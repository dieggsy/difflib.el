[[https://coveralls.io/github/dieggsy/difflib.el?branch=master][file:https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dieggsy/difflib.el/badge.svg?branch=master]]

This is a port of [[https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c62f0cb3b1f6f9ca4ce463b1c99b0543bdfa38d6/Lib/difflib.py][python's difflib]] to emacs-lisp. It provides tools for
computing "human friendly" diffs, which use the notion of the longest
contiguous and junk-free matching subsequence.

** Installation
This package is on melpa. If you have melpa in your package repositories, you
can use ~M-x RET package-install RET difflib~ or install with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package difflib
  :ensure t)
#+end_src

Alternatively, consider installing with [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] or [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]].

Otherwise, download the files to somewhere in your load path, and require
difflib:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'difflib)
#+end_src

** Functions
*** difflib-get-close-matches ~(word possibilities (:n 3) (:cutoff 0.6))~
Use ~difflib-sequence-matcher~ to return a list of the best "good enough"
matches.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(difflib-get-close-matches "appel" '("ape" "apple" "peach" "puppy")) ;; => '("apple" "ape")
(difflib-get-close-matches "wheel" '("if" "while" "with" "except")) ;; => '("while")
(difflib-get-close-matches "apple" '("if" "while" "with" "except")) ;; => nil
(difflib-get-close-matches "accept" '("if" "while" "with" "except")) ;; => '("except")
#+end_src
*** difflib-ndiff ~(a b &key linejunk (charjunk #'difflib-is-character-junk-p))~
Return a delta: the difference between ~a~ and ~b~ (lists of strings).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(difflib-ndiff '("one" "two" "three")
               '("ore" "tree" "emu"))
;; =>
;; '("- one"
;;   "?  ^"
;;   "+ ore"
;;   "?  ^"
;;   "- two"
;;   "- three"
;;   "?  -"
;;   "+ tree"
;;   "+ emu")
#+end_src
*** difflib-unified-diff ~(a b &key ...)~
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(difflib-unified-diff (s-split " " "one two three four")
                      (s-split " " "zero one tree four")
                      :fromfile "Original"
                      :tofile "Current"
                      :fromfiledate "2005-01-26 23:30:50"
                      :tofiledate "2010-04-02 10:20:52")

;; =>
;; '("--- Original\t2005-01-26 23:30:50"
;;   "+++ Current\t2010-04-02 10:20:52"
;;   "@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@"
;;   "+zero"
;;   " one"
;;   "-two"
;;   "-three"
;;   "+tree"
;;   " four")
#+end_src
*** difflib-context-diff ~(a b &key ...)~
For two lists of strings, return a delta in context diff format.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(difflib-context-diff (s-split " " "one two three four")
                      (s-split " " "zero one tree four")
                      :fromfile "Original"
                      :tofile "Current")
;; =>
;; '("*** Original"
;;   "--- Current"
;;   "***************"
;;   "*** 1,4 ****"
;;   "  one"
;;   "! two"
;;   "! three"
;;   "  four"
;;   "--- 1,4 ----"
;;   "+ zero"
;;   "  one"
;;   "! tree"
;;   "  four")
#+end_src
*** difflib-restore ~(delta which)~
Return one of the two sequences that generated a ~difflib-ndiff~ delta.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(difflib-restore
 (difflib-ndiff '("one" "two" "three") '("ore" "tree" "emu"))
 1) ;; => '("one" "two" "three")

(difflib-restore
 (difflib-ndiff '("one" "two" "three") '("ore" "tree" "emu"))
 2) ;; => '("ore" "tree" "emu")
#+end_src
** Classes
*** difflib-sequence-matcher
A flexible class for comparing deltas of sequences of any type.
*** difflib-differ
For producing human-readable deltas from sequences of lines of text.
