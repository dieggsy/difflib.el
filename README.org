* difflib.el

This is a naive port of [[https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c62f0cb3b1f6f9ca4ce463b1c99b0543bdfa38d6/Lib/difflib.py][python's difflib]] to emacs-lisp. I say naive because
it's a little better than a literal translation of a book - it does what it
needs to do, but it may not necessarily make use of the second language's power
or beaty.

At the moment, it only contains an implementation of the ~SequenceMatcher~ class
and the ~get_close_matches~ function, since in my opinion those are the most
useful for elisp, and I wanted to use them for another project. (See todo table
below).

** Todo [1/4]
 - [X] Port SequenceMatcher
 - [ ] Use hash tables instead of alists?
